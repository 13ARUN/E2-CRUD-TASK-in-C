# Employee Information System

This project is a simple console-based Employee Information System implemented in C. It allows users to manage employee records through various operations such as creating, displaying, updating, and deleting employee data. The system uses basic data structures, dynamic memory allocation, and standard I/O operations to handle employee information efficiently.

## Features

- **Create Employee**: Add a new employee record by entering the name, employee ID, and years of experience. The system ensures that each employee has a unique name and ID.
- **Display Employees**: View the details of all employees or search for a specific employee by their ID.
- **Update Employee**: Modify the name or years of experience of an existing employee using their ID.
- **Delete Employee**: Remove an employee record from the system by providing their ID.

## Prerequisites

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)

## Notes

- The system can store up to 50 employee records.
- Data validation is implemented to prevent duplicate names and IDs.
